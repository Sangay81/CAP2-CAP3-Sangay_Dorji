# Python Snake Game

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame, a Python library for creating games. The game consists of a snake that moves around a grid, eating fruits that appear randomly. The snake grows longer each time it eats a fruit, and the game ends when the snake hits the edge of the grid or collides with itself.

## Installation

To install this game, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can clone the repository and run the main script to start the game.

## Usage

To play the game, run the main script. Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The goal of the game is to eat as many fruits as possible without hitting the edge of the grid or colliding with the snake itself.
